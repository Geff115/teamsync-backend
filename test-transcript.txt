Sprint Planning Meeting - December 16, 2024

Attendees: Sarah (PM), John (Tech Lead), Alice (Designer), Bob (Backend Dev)

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our sprint goals. First priority is the user authentication feature. John, can you lead that?

John: Yes, I'll handle the authentication backend. I need to implement OAuth and JWT tokens. I should have this done by Friday this week.

Sarah: Perfect. Alice, we need the login and signup UI designs. Can you get those to John by Wednesday?

Alice: Absolutely, I'll have the designs ready by end of day Wednesday. I'll also create a style guide for the forms.

Sarah: Great. Bob, we also need to fix that critical bug in the payment processing system. This is urgent.

Bob: I saw that. I'll investigate and fix it today. It's causing checkout failures for some users.

John: Bob, after the bug fix, can you help me with the database migration? We need to add the new user tables.

Bob: Sure, I can do that by Thursday. Just send me the schema.

Sarah: One more thing - we need to prepare the Q4 presentation for stakeholders. Alice, can you work on that next week?

Alice: Yes, I'll have a draft ready by next Monday.

Sarah: Excellent. Let's reconvene on Friday to check progress. Meeting adjourned.
